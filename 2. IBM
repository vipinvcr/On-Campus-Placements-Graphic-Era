31 July 2022 -> Online Round

58 minutes : 10 questions (7 reasoning and aptitude + 3 coding(VERY EASY) [C++] not allowed; only Java, C & Python allowed)

All reasoning done 

Coding:
I don't code in C so, was able to attempt only 1

Rest two were also very easy: 1. Question wasn't explained properly or I used wrong approach
                              2. Required complex C coding that I couldn't do, honestly.
